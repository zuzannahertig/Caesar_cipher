## General info
<br>

The program uses the <b>Caesar cipher</b>, a simple encryption technique that substitutes each letter in the plaintext with a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet, to <b>encrypt and decrypt text</b> with a customizable shift value. 

The user can encrypt and decrypt text with a <b>customizable shift value</b> (ROT13, ROT47, or any other shift). The program will apply the selected transformation to the input text, and output the result.

The program provides the ability to <b>save information</b> from each session to a JSON file, or append it to existing one for future reference.
